Binary packet protocol:

[LENGTH][TYPE][TYPE_PAYLOAD]

LENGTH        uint16_t
TYPE          uint8_t
TYPE_PAYLOAD  uint8_t[]

where:
  LENGTH       - length of whole packet
  TYPE         - type of packet
  TYPE_PAYLOAD - packet specific payload

Note: All multi-byte values are encoded in network byte order (big-endian).



Current TYPEs:
  TYPE           CODE

  INVALID        0x00
  ACK            0x01
  NACK           0x02
  DATA           0x03
  FIN            0x04


INVALID binary packet protocol:

INVALID packet means that the packet type is unknown or invalid.
This type is reserved and should not be used for actual packets.
It is returned by parsing functions when the packet type is not recognized.


ACK binary packet protocol:

[LENGTH][ACK]

LENGTH        uint16_t
TYPE          uint8_t

where:
  LENGTH      = Length of whole packet.
                Must be set to 0x03 (3 bytes).

  ACK         = 0x01

ACK packet means that the last packet was received successfully.
Used for acknowledgment of received packets.



NACK binary packet protocol:

[LENGTH][NACK]

LENGTH        uint16_t
TYPE          uint8_t

where:
  LENGTH      = Length of whole packet.
                Must be set to 0x03 (3 bytes).

  NACK        = 0x02

NACK packet means that the last packet was rejected.
It may be sent due to invalid packet or error condition.



DATA binary packet protocol:

[LENGTH][DATA][PAYLOAD]

LENGTH        uint16_t
TYPE          uint8_t
PAYLOAD       uint8_t[256]

where:
  LENGTH      = Length of whole packet.
                Must be set to 0x0103 (259 bytes).

  DATA        = 0x03

  PAYLOAD     = 256 bytes of binary data.

DATA packet contains binary firmware data to be written to flash memory.
The payload size is fixed at 256 bytes.



FIN binary packet protocol:

[LENGTH][FIN][SIGNATURE]

LENGTH        uint16_t
TYPE          uint8_t
SIGNATURE     uint8_t[256]

where:
  LENGTH      = Length of whole packet.
                Must be set to 0x0103 (259 bytes).

  FIN         = 0x04

  SIGNATURE   = 256 bytes of SHA-512 signature.
                Signature is calculated over the entire image data using SHA-512 hash
                and signed with the server's private key.

FIN packet signals the end of file transfer and includes the signature for verification.
After receiving FIN, the client should verify the signature, then disconnect and proceed
with hardware binary update.
